    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There's nothing better than a good old meal of spaghetti and meatsauce
        Well, there is one thing....Spaghetti Bolognese.
    </p>
    <p>I've always thought that bolognese recipes were ingredient heavy, time-consuming challenges.  Many are, but it
        doesn't <em>have</em> to be that way.</p>
    <p>Read down, and I'll show you an easy, no hassle way to make delicious bolgnese in under an hour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup onions, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 25 oz jar store-bought marinara</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb wide pasta noodles, such as pappardelle or tagliatelle
            Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in carrots along with celery and onions and sauté until they're just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the ground beef and ground pork, and cook until browned, breaking up the meat as you stir.</li>
        <li>Pour in the jar of store-bought marinara sauce along with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>When the Bolognese sauce has reached your desired consistency, stir in the heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and serve over your favorite pasta—we like to use pappardelle or tagliatelle—and top with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
