    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mac n' Cheese is my <em>ultimate</em> comfort food.  In fact, it's the first meal I remember being able to make by myself when I was a kid.  Let's check out my favorite way of throwing this classic dish together.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Keep cooking and stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, roughly 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
    </ol>
